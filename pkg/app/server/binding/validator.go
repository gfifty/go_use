// StructValidator is the minimal interface which needs to be implemented in

// of the request. Hertz provides a default implementation for this using

	// ValidateStruct can receive any kind of type and it should never panic, even if the configuration is not right.
	// If the received type is a slice|array, the validation should be performed travel on every element.
	// If the received type is not a struct or slice|array, any validation should be skipped and nil must be returned.
	// If the received type is a struct or pointer to a struct, the validation should be performed.
	// If the struct is not valid or the validation itself fails, a descriptive error should be returned.
	// Otherwise nil must be returned.
